- To find taska that have not yet been completed or you plan on doing something lated. Just leave it in a todo. Locate the file, **tasks.todo** and see a list of tasks that have not been done. You can add or remove tasks depending on the completion. This helps others to know what's missing.
- If it's missing, then it's already done. :)
